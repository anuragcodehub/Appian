Here we will document details of Appian usecases implementation

##Case 0 - User needs to build a new Appian Application, how can user start and what best practices needs to be followed during development
Solution - 
            Connect with business and end user to understand current process and bottlenecks properly. Document all details along with Appian best practices to be followed
            Break the big processes into small functional cases for development team to start the development with
            Define the different user roles who can access the appian process and configure security of appian objects accordingly
            Have a database design ready before full fledge development is started, confirm database design with architect or lead, explain everyone in team about the design
            Start building the Appian application
            Get the functionalities reviewed by business or end user periodically to avoid deviations from actual expectations


##Case 1 - User needs to upload excel file having 100 columns in Appian, validate and transform the data and populate data in different tables. 
Solution - 
            Create a staging / temp table having same number of columns as in excel
            Create an Appian process to validate the file and dump the uploaded excel file data to temp table
              Plugin to be used - https://community.appian.com/b/appmarket/posts/excel-tools , Smart Service - Import Excel to Database
            Create stored procedures for data validation and transformation
            Show the final results of file upload to end user
        

##Case 2 - User needs to implement a scheduler in Appian to run periodically and perform certain set of activities in Appian
Solution - 
            Create an Appian process and configure all activities required to be done
            Configure the start node of the process model to configure the timer when the process needs to be triggered automatically

##Case 3 - Good design practices during creation of Integrations in Appian
Solution - 

When creating integrations in Appian, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure efficient and effective design. Here are some key best practices for designing and creating integrations in Appian based on the provided sources:

1. **Naming and Configuration**:
   - Follow the recommended naming standard when naming the integration.
   - Provide a brief description of the integration to enhance clarity.
   - Save the integration in an appropriate folder for easy organization and management[1][3].

2. **Connection Details and Parameters**:
   - Select a connected system or provide authentication details based on the integration requirements.
   - Define request body, content type, parameters, and headers as needed for the integration method (e.g., POST, PUT, PATCH)[1][3].

3. **Testing and Troubleshooting**:
   - Test the integration thoroughly to ensure proper functionality.
   - View details about the request, response, errors, and recommended next steps in the integration designer.
   - Define inputs for reusability and configure default test values for efficient testing[3].

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Add custom error handling within the integration to construct custom error messages.
   - Use a!integrationError() to return errors when needed, ensuring proper error handling and management[3].

5. **Automatic Parsing**:
   - Configure automatic parsing for JSON responses to convert results into Appian values automatically.
   - This feature simplifies data handling and allows for easy access to response data using dot notation and index()[3].

By adhering to these best practices, you can design and create integrations in Appian that are well-structured, efficient, and robust, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration with external systems.

##Case 4 - Good design practices during creation of Portals in Appian
Solution - 

To create an Appian object Portal, here are some best practices for designing and creating portals based on the provided sources:

1. **Naming and Configuration**:
   - Enter a name following the recommended standard for the portal object.
   - Define a display name for the portal visible to end-users.
   - Assign a unique web address identifier for the portal.
   - Provide a description for the portal object.
   - Ensure proper configurations for publishing the portal and setting up the web address[1].

2. **Security**:
   - Control access to the portal using service accounts.
   - Implement design-time and runtime security protections to safeguard the portal.
   - Define different permission levels for administrators, editors, and viewers to manage portal actions[1].

3. **Design Guidance**:
   - Follow design guidance recommendations and warnings to reinforce best practices.
   - Address warnings related to invalid parameters, misconfigured data stores, missing document permissions, and connected system plug-ins.
   - Update rule inputs and configurations as needed to maintain optimal portal performance[3].

4. **Compatibility and Integration**:
   - Ensure compatibility with portals by using components and functions that are compatible with portal environments.
   - Utilize integration objects and web APIs to connect partially compatible capabilities to the portal.
   - Create custom integrations to bridge the portal with Appian and allow seamless data flow[2].

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Avoid unnecessary database queries in interfaces, expression rules, and other objects.
   - Optimize looping functions by using the Choose() function instead of nested IF conditions.
   - Implement paging and filtering for records to enhance performance and avoid loading all items at once[4].

6. **User Experience**:
   - Design the portal interface considering time zones and localization.
   - Ensure a seamless experience for users accessing the portal without the need to log in.
   - Use low-code tools to create web apps that connect users to information and processes efficiently[5].

By following these best practices, you can design and create an Appian object Portal that is secure, efficient, and user-friendly, meeting the needs of your organization and audience effectively.
